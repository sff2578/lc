# Testcase Example:  '[-4,-1,0,3,10]'
#
# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array
# of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
# Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
# Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
# After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
# Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial,
# could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?
