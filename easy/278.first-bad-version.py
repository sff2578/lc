#
# You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new
# product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality
# check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the
# versions after a bad version are also bad.
#
# Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first
# bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
#
# You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version
# is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should
# minimize the number of calls to the API.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 5, bad = 4
# Output: 4
# Explanation:
# call isBadVersion(3) -> false
# call isBadVersion(5) -> true
# call isBadVersion(4) -> true
# Then 4 is the first bad version.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 1, bad = 1
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1
#

# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# def isBadVersion(version: int) -> bool:


class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        # if not bad, s=m+1
        # if bad, e=m, because m might be the first one
        s, e = 0, n
        while s < e:  # end at s==e
            m = (s + e) // 2
            bad = isBadVersion(m)
            if not bad:
                s = m + 1
            else:
                e = m
        return s
