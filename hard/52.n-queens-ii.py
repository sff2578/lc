# The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard
# such that no two queens attack each other.
#
# Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to theÂ n-queens
# puzzle.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as
# shown.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 1
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= n <= 9
