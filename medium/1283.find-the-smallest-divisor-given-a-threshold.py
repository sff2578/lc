#
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer threshold, we will choose a
# positive integer divisor, divide all the array by it, and sum the division's
# result. Find the smallest divisor such that the result mentioned above is
# less than or equal to threshold.
#
# Each result of the division is rounded to the nearest integer greater than or
# equal to that element. (For example: 7/3 = 3 and 10/2 = 5).
#
# The test cases are generated soÂ that there will be an answer.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
# Output: 5
# Explanation: We can get a sum to 17 (1+2+5+9) if the divisor is 1.
# If the divisor is 4 we can get a sum of 7 (1+1+2+3) and if the divisor is 5
# the sum will be 5 (1+1+1+2).
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [44,22,33,11,1], threshold = 5
# Output: 44
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
# nums.length <= threshold <= 10^6
#
#
